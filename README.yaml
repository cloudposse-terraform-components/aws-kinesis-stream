    terraform:
      kinesis-stream/defaults:
        metadata:
          type: abstract
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          enabled: true
          tags:

  ```

  ```yaml

  components:
    terraform:
      kinesis-example:
        metadata:
          component: kinesis-stream
          inherits:
            - kinesis-stream/defaults
        vars:
          name: kinesis-stream-example
          stream_mode: ON_DEMAND
          # shard_count: 2  # This does nothing if `stream_mode` is set to `ON_DEMAND`
          kms_key_id: "alias/aws/kinesis"
  ```
